    "### Primitive Data Types\n",
    "Python has several basic data types that you will use frequently:\n",
    "* **String (`str`):** A string of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `\"Hello\"`).\n",
    "* **Integer (`int`):** Whole numbers without decimal places (e.g., `123`). To make large integers readable, you can use underscores (e.g., `123_456`), which Python ignores during processing.\n",
    "* **Float (`float`):** Floating-point numbers, meaning numbers with decimal places (e.g., `3.14159`).\n",
    "* **Boolean (`bool`):** Represents truth values. It can only be `True` or `False` (Capitalized, no quotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscripting\n",
    "You can pull out individual characters from a string using square brackets `[]`. This is called **subscripting**.\n",
    "* **Index starts at 0:** The first character is at index 0.\n",
    "* **Negative Indexing:** You can count backwards from the end of the string. `-1` gets the last character."
